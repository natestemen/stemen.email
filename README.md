# stemen.email
A small website for the email domain I'm using.

## process
I'm currently still in the phase of moving all my accounts over to this new
email, so things aren't fully worked out, but I thought I'd give an overview of
how I'm using it.

Email hosting on fastmail allows you to accept email to everything at
`foo@stemen.email` where `foo` is any string (I'm sure there are some
limitations to this, but I haven't looked into it too deeply). This feature
allows me to use a distinct email for any service I use.

If I'm signing up for an account with a company called cupcakes, I'd most likely
just use the email `cupcakes@stemen.email`.

In an age of data-brokerage you can bet there are companies aggregating emails
across multiple services in order to map out who is on which platforms. I
obviously don't know the inner workings of these things, but presumably having
different emails on different websites makes it much more difficult to say
`foo@stemen.email` is the same person as `bar@stemen.email`. 

## downsides
Giving my email over the phone is a bit odd at times. Most people aren't up to
date about what TLD's are available or even outside of the common ones that they
even exist. I gave my email `nate@stemen.email` over the phone recently and the
operator told me "I've never seen one like that!" I also had a webpage try and
correct my email to `nate@stemen.mil` presumably thinking `email` wasn't a valid
TLD, but it still allowed me to submit my email.
