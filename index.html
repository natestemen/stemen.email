    <p>send me an email at <a id='email' href="mailto:nate@stemen.email"><code>nate@stemen.email</code></a> or click <button onclick="copyEmail()">here</button> to just copy my email address to your clipboard. you can also reach me at <code>foo@bar.stemen.email</code>            where <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are your favorite non-empty strings (they may have to be <code>a-z</code> though, not so sure about that).</p>

    <p>i've wanted to move away from using gmail for a long time (mostyly because privacy, but <a href="https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/">other reasons</a> as well), and I actually tried self hosting my email for a bit before I just decided for something
        as important as email, I'd rather just trust someone else at this point. It is a slight privacy sacrifice, but communicating with other sometimes take priority over complete privacy, and most people I email probably use gmail anyway. I do
        love the idea of self hosting, but I don't don't know if I have the time right now to manage it. After a moderate amount of research on email hosting providers I landed on <a href="https://fastmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastmail</a>            as a company that takes privacy seriously, the modernization of email seriously, and user experience seriously.</p>
