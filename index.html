    <p>send me an email at <a href="mailto:nate@stemen.email"><code>nate@stemen.email</code></a> or click <button onclick="copyEmail()">here</button> to just copy my email address to your clipboard. you can also reach me at <code>foo@bar.stemen.email</code> where <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are your favorite non-empty strings (they may have to be <code>a-z</code> though, not so sure about that).</p>
    <p>i've wanted to move away from using gmail for a long time (mostly because privacy, but <a href="https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/">other reasons</a> as well), and I actually tried self hosting my email for a bit before I just decided for something as important as email, I'd rather just trust someone else at this point. It is a slight privacy sacrifice, but communicating with other sometimes take priority over complete privacy, and most people I email probably use gmail anyway. I do love the idea of self hosting, but I don't don't know if I have the time right now to manage it. After a moderate amount of research on email hosting providers I landed on <a href="https://fastmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastmail</a> as a company that takes privacy seriously, the modernization of email seriously, and user experience seriously.</p>
    <p>below is an email forwarding diagram i've put together of all the of the emails i can remember, and want to share. we all have some emails that we'll never share with others, right? as you can see, i've currently got a few redirecting to my <code>nate@stemen.email</code> address. while this address is still under a year old, i think it makes sense to have the redirects. after about a year of using it, and making sure all my accounts are using <code>stemen.email</code> emails, i'll turn off the forwarding and close the accounts. that'll be a nice day.</p>
