    <p>Send me an email at <a
    href="mailto:nate@stemen.email"><code>nate@stemen.email</code></a> or click
    <button onclick="copyEmail()">here</button> to copy my email to your
    clipboard.</p>
    <p>I've wanted to move away from using gmail for a long time (mostly because
    privacy, but <a href="https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/">other
    reasons</a> as well) and buying a domain (<code>stemen.email</code> in my
    case) was the first step. This serves two purposes
    <ul>
      <li>you get to choose your exact email</li>
      <li>you can change providers when you decide their privacy policy is no
      longer up to your standards</li>
    </ul>
    I first tried self hosting email, but found the difficulty to be slightly
    more than I wanted to do at the time. I may try again in the future, because
    it does have lots of pros. It is a slight privacy sacrifice, but
    communicating with other sometimes take priority over complete privacy, and
    most people I email probably use gmail anyway.
    </p>
    <p>After a moderate amount of research on email hosting providers I landed
    on
    <a href="https://fastmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener
    noreferrer">fastmail</a> as a company that takes privacy seriously, the
    modernization of email seriously, and user experience seriously.
    </p>
    <p>Below is an email forwarding diagram I've put together of all the of the
    emails I can remember, and want to share. We all have some emails that we'll
    never share with others, right? As you can see, I've currently got a few
    redirecting to my <code>nate@stemen.email</code> address. While this address
    is still under a year old, I think it makes sense to have the redirects.
    After about a year of using it, and making sure all my accounts are using
    <code>stemen.email</code> emails, I'll turn off the forwarding and close the
    accounts. That'll be a nice day.</p>
